/**
 * BB.DP.007 Make change
 * 
 * Question : Given a value N, if we want to make change for N cents, and we
 * have infinite supply of each of S = { S1, S2, .. , Sm} valued coins, how many
 * ways can we make the change? The order of coins doesnâ€™t matter.
 * 
 * e.g.
 * 
 * For N = 4 and S = {1,2,3}, there are four solutions:
 * {1,1,1,1},{1,1,2},{2,2},{1,3}. So output should be 4.
 * 
 * For N = 10 and S = {2, 5, 3, 6}, there are five solutions: {2,2,2,2,2},
 * {2,2,3,3}, {2,2,6}, {2,3,5} and {5,5}. So the output should be 5.
 * 
 * Solution:
 * 
 * To count the total number of solutions, we can divide all set solutions into
 * two sets.
 * 
 * 1) Solutions that do not contain mth coin (or Sm).
 * 
 * 2) Solutions that contain at least one Sm.
 * 
 * Let count(S[], m, n) be the function to count the number of solutions, then
 * it can be written as sum of count(S[], m-1, n) and count(S[], m, n-Sm).
 * 
 * Therefore, the problem has optimal substructure property as the problem can
 * be solved using solutions to subproblems.
